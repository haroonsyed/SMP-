# SMP-
Previously a "Simple Multiplayer" minecraft plugin. Became a decently sized plugin with any functionality I wanted on my server.

This is the first major programming project I undertook, other than the fishing game from 12th grade. This showcases my development and growth in object oriented programming.
Containing some of the earliest code I have written, it contains all the basic mistakes of a novice. Including static abuse, disorganized structure, lack of whitespace.
However, it also show cases my growth, including learning dependency injection, inheritance, polymorphism, collection types, hashmap, file IO, git itself, learning other's APIs,
and more.

The endeavour started off as a challenge to copy the functionality of somebody else's SMP plugin and customize it to my needs. All I needed to do was make a
teleport/find player command and a sleep notifier. It gradually increased to tenfold the original size. Its functionality includes a chat system, 
basic faction system, fight arenas, griefprevention api hooks(war system), projectkorra hooks(make waterbending stronger at night), a chest to hold items on death
with an included trust system for friends to access it, a chat color changer (linked with faction chat system), an afk notifier requiring learning dependency injection,
a config to save data, location saver, and more.

Although most of these systems are simple on their own, each one required different research, approaches, and data structures to complete. My time spent making this 
was a big contributer to the easy time I had in programming one and two of college.

Dependencies include:
Grief prevention, projectkorra
